Langlang
========

Langlang (the language language) is a small programming language meant to make it easy to write parsers for other languages. It was built for the C.js project, and as such it only targets JavaScript - if you have another preferred target language, let me know. They're not that hard to implement.

Usage
-----

Running the compiler:
```python langlang.py myinput.ll -o myoutput.js```

Writing a langlang file:
```
// TODO: Examples
```

FAQ
---

*There's, like, a billion parser generators. Why does this exist?*
I needed something that allowed for fine-graned controls on the error messages and recovery patterns. C.js targets beginners, so those messages needed to be easy to understand.

*How can I contribute?*
My emails is in [my bio](https://github.com/apccurtiss). If anyone's interested in contributing, send me a message and I'll add contribution directions. I haven't yet because they take time, which is scarse.

*I want changes, but I don't want to contribute.*
File an issue and I'll see what I can do.
